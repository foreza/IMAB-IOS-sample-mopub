# IMAB - IOS Example (with MoPub SDK) mopub-sharknark

This is a sample application to test the MoPub IOS SDK integration with the InMobi IMAB plugin.

This path is typically used by publishers whom are using MoPub today for primary SDK mediation.
What happens is that the publisher integrates the MoPub SDK directly first and requests a bid from InMobi before loading the Mopub ad waterfall. 
This allows for better fill rate across the board.

## Mopub IOS SDK:

Mopub is open source:
https://github.com/mopub/mopub-ios-sdk

## IMAB Plugin:
